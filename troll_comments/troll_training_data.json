What you're refering to as ArcGIS, is in fact, ARC/INFO, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Arc plus Python. ArcGIS is not a GIS unto itself, but rather another proprietary component of a fully functioning GIS made useful by the ARC/INFO corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full GIS as defined by ESRI.\nMany computer users run a modified version of the ARC/INFO GIS every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of ARC/INFO which is widely used today is often called ArcGIS, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically ARC/INFO, developed by ESRI.\nThere really is an ArcGIS, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the program they use. ArcGIS is the wrapper: the program in the program that allocates the program's resources to the tools that you run. The wrapper is an essential part of a program, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete program.

It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A ARCGIS is a ARCGIS and a member of the GIS family. But that's not what you said.

Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking GIS courses so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a banned user. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the editors would ignore. Next, you create some data. I was usually content with envisioning the random output from the Create Random Raster tool in ARC/INFO and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as cartographically charged as me just take some maps on the go. After you're good and ready, you get some WiFi. My login preferred mobile data hotspots but new users might have a taste for public WiFi. Small, secluded areas are unfilled and unmonitored so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your laptop out and join a network within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can get signal. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a park at distances up to 400 feet. You wait for the editors to begin working elsewhere and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to edit gently and fix broken lines to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to edit your feature. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of editing is very frightening to the admins, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past editing experiences. I always edit high areas so I would aim for the bottom of the hill and catch it right in the peak. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those editors reel around fixing mistakes and maybe even replacing it with further mistakes.

Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking GIS courses so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a banned user. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the editors would ignore. Next, you create some data. I was usually content with envisioning the random output from the Create Random Raster tool in ARC/INFO and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as cartographically charged as me just take some maps on the go. After you're good and ready, you get some WiFi. My login preferred mobile data hotspots but new users might have a taste for public WiFi. Small, secluded areas are unfilled and unmonitored so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your laptop out and join a network within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can get signal. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a park at distances up to 400 feet. You wait for the editors to begin working elsewhere and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to edit gently and fix broken lines to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to edit your feature. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of editing is very frightening to the admins, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past editing experiences. I always edit high areas so I would aim for the bottom of the hill and catch it right in the peak. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those editors reel around fixing mistakes and maybe even replacing it with further mistakes.

I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for work in my area.\nAn IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.\n\nMy mother's boyfriend of 8 years is a Spatial Analyst who graduated ESRI lectures. At the age of 15, I understand GIS better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an analyst, but I've met lots of other analysts who aren't as good as me at GIS, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.\nI'm also pretty good at CS. I don't have a degree, and other than GIS I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of geomatics than any actual analyst, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented kriging before finding out what it was, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing georeferencing solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit coordinates; admittedly not the best plan).\n\nI have independently thought of basically every branch of geography I've come across. Every question of projections which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. geography has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a geography course just to see how easy it is.\n\nPsychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike geomatics, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.\n\nI'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.\n\nI don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.\n\nI believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.\n\nI don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.\n\nI love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.\nI'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.\n\nThe only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.\nI consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit \"women are crazy\" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.\n\nThat doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).\nI'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).\n\nAnd, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.\n\nAll that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish.

Our students expect us to protect the high value of Waterloo degrees, and this is a responsibility not taken lightly. All members of our community should be aware that the university is well positioned to detect incidents of academic fraud, and will take swift action against all who are caught in such circumstances. The consequences of being caught cheating are significant and individuals risk being expelled and/or arrested depending on the severity of the offence.\n\nUpon investigation, it appears that the tutorial service EasyAce wrongfully acquired questions that subsequently appeared on the final examination. These questions were distributed to students who attended a for-pay tutorial session held without permission on campus. Students who attended the review session may not have been aware that the questions they received would appear on the exam. Nonetheless, this situation is obviously unfair to a large majority of the students who wrote the exam. \n\nI have considered a wide array of options to resolve the situation. I have instructed that the exam be marked as written, that exams from previous terms be retrieved from storage and that a statistical analysis be done on all comparable questions. If it is discovered that there are unexpected material differences in grade distribution on similar questions from the Winter 2016 examination and previous examinations, these questions will be struck from the Winter 2016 examination and the final examination mark will be recalibrated.\n\nStudents who believe that this process places them at a disadvantage will have the opportunity to write a supplemental exam on the theoretic part of the course. The supplemental exam will be available later in April and in the MATH 136 exam slot in both the Spring 2016 and Fall 2016 final examination schedule. Details will be posted on the course website shortly.\n\nBased on the evidence available to me today, I have no reason to believe that there has been a systemic breach of the exam control protocol. Individuals who are identified as having provided University material to EasyAce, or any tutorial service or website, without permission will be subject to University discipline policy.\n\nThe University of Waterloo expects the highest standard of academic integrity from its entire community. We know that the vast majority of our students pursue their academic work honestly. We also understand the challenges associated with the successful completion of your programs. I encourage all MATH 136 students to make use of the extensive resources available: your instructor, review sessions, assignment and midterm feedback, the Tutorial Centre, study skills workshops available through the Student Success Office, and online material and questions available at http://open.math.uwaterloo.ca.\n\nIt is clear that students are upset at what has happened.
